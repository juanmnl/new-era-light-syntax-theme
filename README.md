# New era light Syntax Theme

I wanted a light theme syntax for coding on bright days, didn't find one that suited me, so here it is.
Best used Atom's ONE LIGHT theme.

If you want to combine it with a great dark syntax,
checkout the dark version [New Era Syntax](https://atom.io/themes/new-era-syntax)

## Screen

Open Atom Preferences > Themes > Search: `new-era-light-syntax`,
then Install.

Activate the theme by selecting the Themes section of Preferences.
